# Bloons

This project was created for my ECE243 class with my group partner Hazel. It was programmed to work on a DE1-SoC board.

The goal of the game is to pop all balloons on the screen by launching a dart. The dart's horizontal and vertical power can be set with the 1st and 2nd pushbuttons. The third pushbutton launches the dart and starts the animation, while the fourth pushbutton restarts the game. The LEDs display the number of remaining darts as well as the player's score.
